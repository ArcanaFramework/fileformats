File handling
=============

In addition to validation of format types, *FileFormats* is able to detect related files,
hash them and move them around the file-system as single object.

Paths
-----

Once a file object is initiated you are able to access the properties of the
format class, which for single file formats is typically just the file-system path,
``fspath``.

.. code-block:: python

   >>> from fileformats.image import Jpeg
   >>> jpeg_file = Jpeg("/path/to/image.jpg")
   >>> jpeg_file.fspath
   "/path/to/image.jpg"

However, file-formats that consist of multiple files (common in scientific
data) will typically define separate required properties for each file. For example, the
Analyze_ neuroimaging format, which stores the image in a file with the extension
".img" and metadata in a separate header file with the extension ".hdr".

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from fileformats.medimage import Analyze
    >>> analyze_file = Analyze(["/path/to/neuroimage.hdr", "/path/to/neuroimage.img"])
    >>> analyze_file.fspath
    "/path/to/neuroimage.img"
    >>> analyze_file.header
    "/path/to/neuroimage.hdr"

To access all file-system paths in a format object you can access the ``fspaths``
attribute from the base class of all file formats ``fileformats.core.base.FileSet``

.. code-block:: python

    >>> analyze_file.fspaths
    {"/path/to/neuroimage.hdr", "/path/to/neuroimage.img"}

In the case of file formats with "adjacent" files that share the same file-name stem,
i.e. same file path and name minus the file extension (such as Analyze_), you only need
to provide one the primary path and the header will be automatically detected and added
to the file-set

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from fileformats.medimage import Analyze
    >>> analyze_file = Analyze("/path/to/neuroimage.img")
    >>> analyze_file.fspaths
    {"/path/to/neuroimage.hdr", "/path/to/neuroimage.img"}

This is very useful when reading the output path of a workflow where only primary path
is returned and associated files also need to be saved to an output directory.

FileSet formats from a format class to a workflow/task input, the transformation
of the format object to a path-like string is handled implicitly through the
implementation of the ``__str__`` and ``__fspath__`` magic methods. This means
that format objects can be used in place of the path objects themselves, e.g.

.. code-block:: python

    import subprocess
    from fileformats.text import Plain
    text_file = Plain("/path/to/text-file.txt")

    with open(text_file) as f:
        contents = f.read()

    subprocess.run(f"cp {text_file} /path/to/destination", shell=True)

Noting that it is only the "primary" path as returned by the ``fspath`` property that
is rendered.


Copy/move files
---------------

To copy all files/directories in a format you can use the ``FileSet.copy()`` method

.. code-block:: python

    >>> analyze_file_copy = analyze_file.copy(dest_dir="/path/to/destination", stem="new-stem")
    >>> analyze_file_copy.fspaths
    {"/path/to/destination/new-stem.hdr", "/path/to/destination/new-stem.img"}
