Read, write and convert
=======================

In addition to the basic features of validation and path handling, it is possible to
implement methods to interact with the data of file format objects via "extras hooks".
Such features are added to selected format classes on a needs basis (pull requests
welcome ðŸ˜Š, see :ref:`Extras`), so are by no means comprehensive, and
are provided "as-is".

Since these features typically rely on a range of external libraries, they are kept in
separate *extras* packages (e.g.
`fileformats-extras <https://pypi.org/project/fileformats-extras/>`__,
`fileformats-medimage-extras <https://pypi.org/project/fileformats-medimage-extras/>`__),
which need to be installed separately.


Metadata
--------

If there has been an extras overload registered for the ``read_metadata`` method,
then metadata associated with the fileset can be accessed via the ``metadata`` property,
e.g.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> dicom.metadata["SeriesDescription"]
    "localizer"

Formats the ``WithSeparateHeader`` and ``WithSideCars`` mixin classes will attempt the
side car if a metadata reader is implemented (e.g. JSON) and merge that with any header
information read from the primary file.


Reading and writing
-------------------

Several classes in the base fileformats package implement ``load`` and ``save`` methods.
An advantage of implementing them  in the format class is that objects instantiated from
them can then be duck-typed in calling functions/methods. For example, both ``Yaml`` and
``Json`` formats (both inherit from the ``TextSerialization`` type) implement the
``load`` method, which returns a dictionary

.. code-block:: python

    from fileformats.application import TextSerialization  # i.e. JSON or YAML

    def read_serialisation(serialized: TextSerialization) -> dict:
        return serialized.load()


Converters
----------

Several conversion methods are available between equivalent file-formats in the standard
classes. For example, archive types such as ``Zip`` can be converted into and generic
file/directories using the ``convert`` classmethod of the target format to convert to

.. code-block:: python

    from fileformats.application import Zip
    from fileformats.generic import Directory

    # Example round trip from directory to zip file
    zip_file = Zip.convert(Directory("/path/to/a/directory"))
    extracted = Directory.convert(zip_file)

The converters are implemented in the Pydra_ dataflow framework, and can be linked into
wider Pydra_ workflows by accessing the underlying converter task with the ``get_converter``
classmethod

.. code-block:: python

    import pydra
    from pydra.tasks.mypackage import MyTask
    from fileformats.image import Gif, Png

    wf = pydra.Workflow(name="a_workflow", input_spec=["in_gif"])
    wf.add(
        Png.get_converter(Gif, name="gif2png", in_file=wf.lzin.in_gif)
    )
    wf.add(
        MyTask(
            name="my_task",
            in_file=wf.gif2png.lzout.out_file,
        )
    )
    ...
